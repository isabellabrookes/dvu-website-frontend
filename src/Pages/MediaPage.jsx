          his video was filmed, edited and published in 1.5 months after the
          idea was formed. We wanted to show the world what the #Circle is all
          about and what better way than to make a short movie?

        <h5>3W HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS SAFETY EVENT</h5>
        <p>
          One of our earliest events was the Safety event held at the Ajman
          Museum under the sponsorship of 3W Healthcare solutions. During this
          event, 3W has provided a presentation on basic first aid and how to
          deal with common injuries and medical situations. Because we are a
          motorsport club, we believe it is important to educate our members on
          basic safety on the road.

        <h5>ALNABOODA AUTOMOBILES EVENT</h5>
        <p>
          During 2019, we have secured a sponsorship deal with Al Nabooda
          Volkswagen and they have become our Brand Sponsor. To celebrate the
          occasion, we held an event at their brand new Bodyshop located in
          Dubai Industrial City. The day was filled with offroading experience
          in the new Touareg as well as a 0-100kmh time attack!
